# Cross-Asset Sentiment Regime Detector

## Automated Market Psychology Analysis Using Transformer-Based NLP

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Cross-Asset Sentiment Regime Detector is a capstone research project that combines advanced natural language processing (NLP) with quantitative finance to create an automated system for detecting market sentiment regimes. By analyzing social media discourse (Reddit) and financial news, the system identifies distinct psychological states in markets and generates actionable trading signals.

### Key Innovation

Traditional sentiment analysis treats market psychology as a continuous variable. This project recognizes that markets operate in distinct **regimes** (euphoria, fear, uncertainty, optimism) and uses transformer-based models to classify these states across multiple asset classes simultaneously.

## 🔬 Research Objectives

1. **Develop a multi-source sentiment aggregation framework** that combines Reddit discussions and financial news using transformer-based NLP (FinBERT, sentiment-focused BERT variants)

2. **Identify distinct sentiment regimes** through unsupervised clustering (k-means, GMM, HMM) of sentiment features across multiple asset classes

3. **Generate cross-asset trading signals** by detecting regime transitions and correlating sentiment patterns with price movements

4. **Validate economic significance** through backtesting on historical data (2020-2024) with risk-adjusted performance metrics
