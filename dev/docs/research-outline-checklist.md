2. **Be Specific** - Vague statements won't pass; use concrete examples and clear language
3. **Follow Template Exactly** - Formatting matters; don't deviate from template
4. **Check Sources** - Ensure peer-reviewed, academic quality sources
5. **Proofread Carefully** - Errors reflect poorly on academic rigor
6. **Submit Early** - Don't wait until last minute; technical issues happen
7. **Keep Backup** - Save multiple copies in different locations

## Success Criteria

Your outline should:

- ✓ Clearly define a specific, researchable problem
- ✓ Demonstrate understanding of existing research
- ✓ Present a testable hypothesis
- ✓ Propose appropriate methods with justification
- ✓ Identify accessible data sources
- ✓ Follow academic writing standards
- ✓ Be formatted according to template
- ✓ Show feasibility for completion in one semester

**Final Advice:**

*Quality over perfection.* Your outline doesn't need to be perfect - it's a preliminary plan that will evolve. Focus on:

1. Clear problem statement
2. Solid hypothesis
3. Appropriate methods
4. Feasible data sources

Your research will develop and improve throughout the semester. This outline gets you started and shows you've thought through the basics.

**You've got this! Submit with confidence.**
