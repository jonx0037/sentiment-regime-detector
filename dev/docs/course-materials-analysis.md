## Writing Guidelines Reviewed

### 1. Writing Research Paper Introductions

**File:** `writing_research_paper_introductions.html`

**Purpose of Research Paper Introduction:**
The introduction leads the reader from a general research issue to specific area of research by:

- Explaining significance of the research being conducted
- Summarizing current understanding (research to date)
- Providing background information about the topic
- Statement of purpose of research issue or problem
- Sometimes followed by hypothesis or set of questions to answer
- May explain methodology and what study can reveal
- May contain summary of rest of paper structure

**Questions Answered in the Introduction (Mental Road Map):**

1. **What am I studying?**
2. **Why is this topic important to investigate?**
3. **What do we already know about this topic?** (What have other experts discovered?)
4. **How will my research advance new knowledge or new ways of understanding?**

**5 Components of Research Paper Introduction:**

#### Component #1: Establish the problem or issue

- Highlight the importance of the problem/issue, and/or
- Make general statements about the problem/issue, and/or
- Present an overview on current research on the issue or problem

#### Component #2: Provide overview of existing thinking/research

About your research problem

#### Component #3: Identify gap or unresolved issues

In existing knowledge/research that your research can fill or identify useful research focus:

- "The previous research has mistakenly assumed that...."
- "Although most experts in the field believe...., they have overlooked...."
- "None of the previous research has examined......"
- "Despite prior observations..., it remains unclear why...."
- "Consequently, these factors need to be examined in more detail...."

#### Component #4: State your research question, hypothesis, and knowledge claim

Making sure to place your research within the gap in existing knowledge:

- State the intent of your study, including research question and hypothesis
- Outline key characteristics of your study
- Describe important results found or hope to find

##### Strategies for Positioning Your Knowledge Claim/Thesis

**Strategies for Positioning Your Knowledge Claim/Thesis:**

1. **Inquisitive Thesis**
   - Shows that subject is "important, curious, or otherwise interesting"
   - Example: "The previous research suggests an interesting correlation between A & B; therefore, my research will...."

2. **Paradoxical Thesis**
   - Focuses on how research will go against commonly believed
   - Searches for unlikely perspectives
   - Example: "Although most experts in the field believe...., they have overlooked.... My research will...."

3. **Corrective Thesis**
   - Shows subject has been neglected, misunderstood, or misrepresented
   - Addresses pre-conceptions that subject is trite or hackneyed
   - Example: "Despite the intense focus on X, few researchers have examined Problem Y......My research will...."

#### Component #5: Stress the value and relevance of your research

- Why is your research relevant?
- What will it contribute to the field (and beyond)?
- Why should we care about your research?

### 2. How to Read a Journal Article

**File:** `how_to_read_a_journal_article.html`

**What is an academic journal article?**
Academic journals are periodicals in which researchers publish their work. They are typically peer-reviewed journals, meaning the work is reviewed and evaluated by other scholars prior to publication to ensure only the best, most rigorously researched articles are published.

**Why read journal articles?**
Journal articles offer a window into the inner workings of a discipline. They demonstrate how social scientists:

- Formulate hypotheses
- Design empirical studies
- Analyze observations collected
- Interpret results

**Understanding Journal Article Structure:**
Journal articles follow a standardized format. Once you understand the structure, knowing where to look for important information becomes much easier.

**Anatomy of a Journal Article:**

| Element | What it is | What it tells you |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **Title** | Presents concise statement of theoretical issues investigated | What is this article about? |
| **Abstract** | One paragraph before article; provides summary of entire article | What topic is author studying? What was primary finding? |
| **Introduction** | Introduces topic; discusses what article contributes to existing knowledge | What is this article about? What does author plan to do? Why should we care about this problem/study? What is author trying to test or show? How does she intend to contribute to the field? |
| **Literature Review** (can be in introduction or separate section) | Discusses previous work, points out remaining questions, relates current research to existing literature | What do we already know about this topic? What have other experts discovered? How have past studies led author to do this particular study? What are the research hypotheses? |
| **Methods and Data** | Provides information about individuals studied and analysis conducted | What data did author use and how did she analyze them? Who were participants? What makes them unique? Is sample good representation of population? Is study qualitative (interviews, ethnography, observation, content analysis), quantitative (statistical analysis), or multi-method? |
| **Results** | Explains what author found | What did the author find? |

**Questions to Ask When Reading Each Section:**

**Title:**

- What is this article about?

**Abstract:**

- What topic is the author studying?
- What was her primary finding?

**Introduction:**

- What is this article about?
- What does the author plan to do in the paper?
- Why should we care about this problem/study?
- What is the author trying to test or show?
- How does she intend to contribute to the field?

**Literature Review:**

- What do we already know about this topic or what have other experts discovered about the topic?
- How have these past studies led the author to do this particular study?
- What are the research hypotheses?

**Methods:**

- What data did the author use and how did she analyze them?
- Who were the participants in this sample?
- What makes them unique?
- Is the sample a good representation of the entire population? If not, how are they different?
- Is the study qualitative (based on interviews, ethnography, participant observation, or content analysis), quantitative (based on statistical analysis), or multi-method (includes both qualitative and quantitative analysis)?

**Results:**

- What did the author find?
