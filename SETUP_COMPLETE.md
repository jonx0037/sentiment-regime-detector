# Workspace Setup Complete ✅

**Date:** January 10, 2026 (Saturday)  
**Status:** Ready for Week 1 work

---

## 🎉 What We Accomplished

### 1. Workspace Reorganization

- ✅ Created 6 subdirectories: `code/`, `config/`, `data/`, `docs/`, `research/`, `results/`
- ✅ Moved 20+ legacy files to proper locations
- ✅ Renamed files to use kebab-case convention
- ✅ Removed old `drafts/` folder

### 2. Git Configuration

- ✅ Created comprehensive `.gitignore` (Python, React, data, secrets)
- ✅ Set up for public GitHub repository
- ✅ Defined branch strategy: `main` (releases) + `develop` (active work)

### 3. Project Management

- ✅ Created **Todoist automation script** (`dev/code/todoist_setup.py`)
  - Auto-creates 30+ tasks across 10-week timeline
  - Organized by week/section with due dates and priorities
  - Run with: `export TODOIST_API_TOKEN="..." && python dev/code/todoist_setup.py`

### 4. Documentation

- ✅ **Main README.md** - Project overview, tech stack, getting started
- ✅ **Week 1 Checklist** (`dev/docs/week-1-checklist.md`) - Detailed task breakdown
- ✅ **Literature Review Prompts** (`dev/research/literature-review-prompts.md`) - Search queries for 5-8 papers

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Time Management

- **Block 4-6 hours/day** for capstone work (Mon-Fri)
- **Front-load literature review** (this weekend) so next week is writing-focused
- **Use Pomodoro technique** (25 min work, 5 min break) for deep focus

### Literature Review

- **Don't over-perfect** - Draft 0 needs breadth, Draft 1 will have depth
- **Use AI tools** (Perplexity, Semantic Scholar) to accelerate search
- **Focus on recent papers** (2018+) for transformer/NLP work

### Writing

- **Write messy first drafts** - You can always revise later
- **One section per day** (Mon: Lit Review, Tue: Methods, Wed: Abstract/Intro)
- **Peer feedback** - Share with classmates for quick review

### Blockers

- **MANEFRAME access delayed?** → Use Google Colab Pro for initial experiments
- **Advisor ghosting?** → Reach out to backup within 48 hours
- **Stuck on writing?** → Ask Claude/ChatGPT for paragraph starters (then rewrite in your voice)
