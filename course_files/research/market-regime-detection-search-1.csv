10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055967,Research on Systemic Financial Risk Measurement Based on HMM and Text Mining: A Case of China Financial Market,"Zhanfeng Li, Yanli Cai, ShuLan Hu",IEEE Access,2021,"The paper considered the sensitivity of unstructured network data to external shocks in the financial system, based on HMM applied in the traditional financial indicator system to construct the new composite index. We integrated economic statistical structure data and internet information, to capture the internal correlation and external shocks to financial markets. There appeared to be some evidence that the new index was superior at measuring the systemic financial risk. In addition, according to the new composite index we constructed, China‚Äôs systemic financial risk was at the medium high level. It is an important task to prevent the systemic financial risk and maintain the stability of macro-economy.",ec54fa8e-607e-4fc2-866a-fec1f4a7b923,14,43,(missing PubMedId)
10.1109/BIGDATA50022.2020.9378332,Explainable Machine Learning for Regime-Based Asset Allocation,"Ruoyun Zhang, Chao Yi, Yixin Chen",2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),2020,"This paper explores an explainable AI model in the financial industry. Macroeconomic and market data serve as inputs of Hierarchical Clustering to distinguish among different economic regimes. Compared with traditional models such as Investment Clock, this method can adjust the classification standard in time according to recent market sentiment. The regime, therefore, can be interpreted by not only macro indicators but also investors‚Äô mood swings using Artificial Intelligence. When we compute the statistical characteristics of returns of each asset, we find that they can be well distinguished among regimes. This method can also identify the abnormally large wave of the stock market from 2015 to 2016 by separating it as an unusual regime, which cannot be realized by traditional methods. The clustering technique enables us to explain and understand the current market status and predict different assets‚Äô performances. Therefore, thanks to the superior interpretability of AI, the mean and variance of returns in each regime are estimated and viewed as viewpoints of the Black-Litterman asset allocation model to construct portfolios. To simulate the real situation, a dynamic backtesting method is used and asset weights change because of the rolling time windows. The results show that equipped with a simple timing strategy, the clustering technique can improve the results and yield excess returns. Some other machine learning techniques are also applied in an attempt to improve the model.",b8f83500-d04d-472f-bfbd-9cad0bfffa03,11,16,(missing PubMedId)
10.1057/S41260-024-00376-X,Downside Risk Reduction Using Regime-Switching Signals: A Statistical Jump Model Approach,"Yizhan Shu, Chenyu Yu, John M. Mulvey",Journal of Asset Management,2024,"This article investigates a regime-switching investment strategy aimed at mitigating downside risk by reducing market exposure during anticipated unfavorable market regimes. We highlight the statistical jump model (JM) for market regime identification, a recently developed robust model that distinguishes itself from traditional Markov-switching models by enhancing regime persistence through a jump penalty applied at each state transition. Our JM utilizes a feature set comprising risk and return measures derived solely from the return series, with the optimal jump penalty selected through a time series cross-validation method that directly optimizes strategy performance. Our empirical analysis evaluates the realistic out-of-sample performance of various strategies on major equity indices from the US, Germany, and Japan from 1990 to 2023, in the presence of transaction costs and trading delays. The results demonstrate the consistent outperformance of the JM-guided strategy in reducing risk metrics such as volatility and maximum drawdown, and enhancing risk-adjusted returns like the Sharpe ratio, when compared to both hidden Markov model-guided strategy and the buy-and-hold strategy. These findings underline the enhanced persistence, practicality, and versatility of strategies utilizing JMs for regime-switching signals.",a45e748f-c215-4fdd-8eaf-315aa106e783,13,65,(missing PubMedId)

10.3390/JRFM13120311,Regime-Switching Factor Investing with Hidden Markov Models,"Matthew Wang, Yi‚ÄêHung Lin, Ilya V. Mikhelson",(missing journal),2020,"This study uses the hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify different market regimes in the US stock market and proposes an investment strategy that switches factor investment models depending on the current detected regime. We first backtested an array of different factor models over a roughly 10.5 year period from January 2007 to September 2017, then we trained the HMM on S&P 500 ETF historical data to identify market regimes of that period. By analyzing the relationship between factor model returns and different market regimes, we are able to establish the basis of our regime-switching investing model. We then back-tested our model on out-of-sample historical data from September 2017 to April 2020 and found that it both delivers higher absolute returns and performs better than each of the individual factor models according to traditional portfolio benchmarking metrics.",903c9e7b-d04c-4a05-ae38-5507103e2acd,17,48,(missing PubMedId)

10.1145/3383455.3422521,A Hybrid Learning Approach to Detecting Regime Switches in Financial Markets,"Peter Akioyamen, Yi Tang, Hussien Hussien",arXiv: Statistical Finance,2021,"Financial markets are of much interest to researchers due to their dynamic and stochastic nature. With their relations to world populations, global economies and asset valuations, understanding, identifying and forecasting trends and regimes are highly important. Attempts have been made to forecast market trends by employing machine learning methodologies, while statistical techniques have been the primary methods used in developing market regime switching models used for trading and hedging. In this paper we present a novel framework for the detection of regime switches within the US financial markets. Principal component analysis is applied for dimensionality reduction and the k-means algorithm is used as a clustering technique. Using a combination of cluster analysis and classification, we identify regimes in financial markets based on publicly available economic data. We display the efficacy of the framework by constructing and assessing the performance of two trading strategies based on detected regimes.",0dedf83a-f3e9-45ec-935b-d73111abac50,9,63,(missing PubMedId)
