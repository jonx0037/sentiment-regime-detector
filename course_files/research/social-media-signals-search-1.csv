10.32996/JCSTS.2024.6.1.7,Harmonizing Macro-Financial Factors and Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Forecasting Stock Market Trends,"Md Shahedul Amin, Eftekhar Hossain Ayon, Bishnu Padh Ghosh, Md Salim Chowdhury MD, Mohammad Shafiquzzaman Bhuiyan, Rasel Mahmud Jewel, Ahmed Ali Linkon",Journal of Computer Science and Technology Studies,2024,"The surge in generative artificial intelligence technologies, exemplified by systems such as ChatGPT, has sparked widespread interest and discourse prominently observed on social media platforms like Twitter. This paper delves into the inquiry of whether sentiment expressed in tweets discussing advancements in AI can forecast day-to-day fluctuations in stock prices of associated companies. Our investigation involves the analysis of tweets containing hashtags related to ChatGPT within the timeframe of December 2022 to March 2023. Leveraging natural language processing techniques, we extract features, including positive/negative sentiment scores, from the collected tweets. A range of classifier machine learning models, encompassing gradient boosting, decision trees and random forests, are employed to train on tweet sentiments and associated features for the prediction of stock price movements among key companies, such as Microsoft and OpenAI. These models undergo training and testing phases utilizing an empirical dataset gathered during the stipulated timeframe. Our preliminary findings reveal intriguing indications suggesting a plausible correlation between public sentiment reflected in Twitter discussions surrounding ChatGPT and generative AI and the subsequent impact on market valuation and trading activities concerning pertinent companies, gauged through stock prices. This study aims to forecast bullish or bearish trends in the stock market by leveraging sentiment analysis derived from an extensive dataset comprising 500,000 tweets. In conjunction with this sentiment analysis derived from Twitter, we incorporate control variables encompassing macroeconomic indicators, Twitter uncertainty index and stock market data for several prominent companies.",3c03f034-202b-4399-b8e0-4d7e403f505a,19,34,(missing PubMedId)

Kharmega Sundararaj, Jiewen Ren",Elements,2020,"With data accumulated at a rapid phase through multiple channels, algorithmic trading becomes critical in stock markets and crypto markets. In algorithmic trading, an innovative approach to integrating machine learning can provide data-driven solutions to help people invest with minimal risk and maximum returns. This study explores various machine learning techniques to model the nonlinear relationship between bitcoin prices and social sentiment data and predict the price values with some lead time. Also, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and lacking strict governing bodies and regulators across regions making it more complex and challenging to predict the prices. Through the analysis, it is found that the sentiment data model is superior in capturing the nonlinear relationship compared to the conventional methods of technical indicators and decision trees, while the neural network models are robust and offer better accuracy in predicting bitcoin price.",6e80dba5-ef77-4eca-bbd1-5ad24231a499,20,14,(missing PubMedId)
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3399548,Stock Market Prediction With Transductive Long Short-Term Memory and Social Media Sentiment Analysis,"Ali Peivandizadeh, Sima Hatami, Amirhossein Nakhjavani, Lida Khoshsima, Mohammad Reza Chalak Qazani, Muhammad Abdel Haleem, Roohallah Alizadehsani",IEEE Access,2023,"In an era dominated by digital communication, the vast amounts of data generated from social media and financial markets present unique opportunities and challenges for forecasting stock market prices. This paper proposes an innovative approach that harnesses the power of social media sentiment analysis combined with stock market data to predict stock prices, directly addressing the critical challenges in this domain. A major challenge in sentiment analysis is the uneven distribution of data across different sentiment categories. Traditional models struggle to accurately identify fewer common sentiments (minority class) due to the overwhelming presence of more common sentiments (majority class). To tackle this, we introduce the Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, specifically designed to handle class imbalance by adjusting the reward mechanism in the training phase, thus favoring the correct classification of minority class instances. Another challenge is effectively integrating the temporal dynamics of stock prices with sentiment analysis results. Our solution is implementing a Transductive Long Short-Term Memory (TLSTM) model that incorporates sentiment analysis findings with historical stock data. This model excels at recognizing temporal patterns and gives precedence to data points that are temporally closer to the prediction point, enhancing the prediction accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the Off-policy PPO and TLSTM components on the overall model performance. The proposed approach advances the field of financial analytics by providing a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics but also offers actionable insights for investors and policymakers seeking to navigate the complexities of the stock market with greater precision and confidence.",cc692c96-76ca-47fa-9def-3f66a04becc4,34,62,(missing PubMedId)

Verykios","International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications",2022,"In a paper that was anonymously published and signed by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was introduced to the world. Due to its enormous success, a great number of cryptocurrencies were created in the upcoming years. This exponential growth relies mostly on the extreme volatility of the market, which led many people to become interested and get involved, primarily for profit. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts tend to share and learn news and opinions on social media platforms, one of the most popular being Twitter. In this paper, we study the extent to which Twitter sentiment analysis can be used to predict price fluctuations for cryptocurrencies. Initially, we gathered tweets and price data of seven of the most popular cryptocurrencies, which were processed to perform sentiment analysis using Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER). The time-series stationarity was determined with Augmented Dicky Fuller (ADF) Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin (KPSS) tests and then Granger Causality testing took place. While price fluctuations seem to cause sentiment for Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP and Doge, predictability was found for Ethereum and Polkadot, based on a bullishness ratio. Finally, predictability of price returns is examined with Vector Autoregression (VAR) and highly accurate forecasts for two of the seven cryptocurrencies were achieved. More specifically, price forecasts of Ethereum‚Äôs and Polkadot‚Äôs prices reached 99.67% and 99.17% accuracy, respectively.",a4368115-c47b-4748-9628-fd480d7deaca,30,40,(missing PubMedId)

In this paper, we explore the usability of different natural language processing models for the sentiment analysis of social media applied to financial market prediction, using the cryptocurrency domain as a reference. We study how the different sentiment metrics are correlated with the price movements of Bitcoin. For this purpose, we explore different methods to calculate the sentiment metrics from a text finding most of them not very accurate for this prediction task. We find that one of the models outperforms more than 20 other public ones and makes it possible to fine-tune it efficiently given its interpretable nature. Thus we confirm that interpretable artificial intelligence and natural language processing methods might be more valuable practically than non-explainable and non-interpretable ones. In the end, we analyze potential causal connections between the different sentiment metrics and the price movements.",9b381cbe-c8e1-4ce2-9a04-a9e095be53ee,14,24,(missing PubMedId)
(missing DOI),Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using News and Social Media Sentiment,"Eric  Nielsen,  Eric  Redondo,  Connor  Lamon",(missing journal),2016,"This project analyzes the ability of news and social media data to predict price fluctuations for three cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum. Traditional supervised learning algorithms were utilized for text-based sentiment classification, but with a twist. Daily news and social media data was labeled based on actual price changes one day in the future for each coin, rather than on positive or negative sentiment. By taking this approach, the model is able to directly predict price fluctuations instead of needing to first predict sentiment. The final version of the model was able to correctly predict, on average, the days with the largest percent increases and percent decreases in price for bitcoin and ethereum over the 67 days encompassing the test set.",a79387a7-a7ee-4134-81d7-0b62a5427be5,0,0,(missing PubMedId)

10.1111/EXSY.12493,Advanced social media sentiment analysis for short‚Äêterm cryptocurrency price prediction,Krzysztof Wo≈Çk,Expert Syst. J. Knowl. Eng.,2020,"In recent years, the scrutiny of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal and regulated components of financial systems has been increasing. Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short‚Äêterm prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices.",ac4ff385-447d-4373-aa2b-447e2d31696b,122,39,(missing PubMedId)
