10.1186/S40854-024-00675-7,Investor sentiment networks: mapping connectedness in DJIA stocks,"Kingstone Nyakurukwa,  Yudhvir Seetharam",Financial Innovation,2025,"Abstract This study examines the connectedness of firm-level online investor sentiment using Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent stocks. Leveraging two proxies of online textual sentiment, namely news media and social media sentiment, we investigate sentiment connectedness at two levels: frequency interval and asymmetric level. Frequency connectedness dissects connectedness into short-, medium-, and long-term investing horizons, while asymmetric connectedness focuses on the transmission of positive and negative sentiment shocks on news and social media platforms. Our results reveal interesting patterns in which both news and social media sentiments demonstrate consistency in connectedness across the short-, medium-, and long-term. Regarding asymmetric connectedness, we observe that negative news sentiment has a higher connectedness than positive news sentiments.",339e74fd-11cc-4356-b716-2a854fed8989,3,49,(missing PubMedId)

10.2139/SSRN.5086825,Limitations of News Sentiment Analysis in Short-term Stock Return Prediction: A Multi-Level Approach,Gael Kengmegni,(missing journal),2024,"In this paper, I investigate the challenges and limitations of using news sentiment analysis for predicting next-day stock returns in the U.S. equity market. While sentiment analysis has shown promise in long-term market prediction, its effectiveness for short-term prediction remains contentious. I propose a novel multi-level approach that integrates sentiment analysis across individual stocks, industries, and the broader economy, extending previous hierarchical market analysis frameworks using a comprehensive dataset combining financial news from Bloomberg, Reuters, and Yahoo Finance (2009-2023). My methodology employs an instruction-pre trained LLaMA 3 8B model for sentiment analysis, selected benchmarking against other state-of-the-art models including RoBERTa Large, FinBERT, and LLaMA 3 8B on the FiQA and FPB datasets. Following recent advances in financial NLP, I augment traditional sentiment features with market data, implementing separate models of high-coverage (>150 articles annually) and low-coverage stocks to account for varying news frequency. My results demonstrate several key findings. First, even with sophisticated sentiment analysis and feature augmentation, accurate next-day return prediction remains elusive, supporting the efficient market hypothesis at short time horizons. Second, when incorporating both sentiment and market features, models tend to overfit on price-based features, diminishing the impact of sentiment signals. Third, I find that economy-wide sentiment features demonstrate higher predictive power than industry specific or stock-specific sentiment, suggesting the importance of broader market sentiment over individual stock news. My trading strategy back tests reveal that the most robust results come from focusing on less-covered stocks with the consistent correlation between sentiment and returns, though even these strategies show limited economic significance when accounting for transaction costs. Surprisingly, sources often considered less reliable (Benzinga, Zacks) showed more stable sentiment signals than traditional news providers. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature on the limitations of sentiment-based trading strategies and highlight the importance of realistic expectations in sentiment driven algorithmic trading. It should be noted that all analyses and conclusions are subject to the limitations of the underlying datasets used, including potential survivorship bias in the stock universe and varying quality of news coverage across different sources and time periods.

One method involves ana-lyzing opinions from individuals and experts. This article focuses on analyzing social media sen-timents for predicting Bitcoin prices using various criteria. In this article, unlike other articles that only used the points obtained from sentiment analysis of tweets, we combined the points of tweets based on other criteria, such as the highest like counts, the highest volume of tweets, and the weighted scores of tweets. In the first stage, we evaluated the deep learning models SL, LG, LGC, BL, and BG without considering sentiment. Ultimately, the BG model performed well in evaluation metrics such as MAE and Loss. In the second stage, we examined the impact of tweet volume on the models&amp;#039; performance. In the third stage, we utilized the simulation results of the VADER model. For the fourth stage, we considered the maximum likes for tweets as a sentiment analysis tool. Finally, in the last stage, which is the main focus of this article, we employed weighted averaging for sentiment analysis. Model BG provided approximately 11% improvement based on the MAE metric and about 15% improvement based on the Loss metric for better detection the following day.",b750c879-2ff4-4599-95cb-3208d6934ec5,0,0,(missing PubMedId)

Drawing on the accessibility‚Äêdiagnosticity framework, we examined the negative spillover effect of the crisis using a natural language processing approach. We specifically assessed whether there was a negative spillover from FTX to other crypto entities with different levels of diagnostic attribute similarity. We collected a large corpus of Twitter conversations related to the FTX collapse in 2022 and used the association rule analysis to determine the association between FTX and other crypto entities. Our analysis revealed that the number of tweets mentioning FTX and other crypto entities changed in line with a series of real‚Äêworld events during the FTX crisis. The negative spillover of the FTX crisis occurred primarily during the first 10 days as the FTX scandal unfolded. The results indicated that the FTX crisis spilled over to highly accessible and diagnostic crypto entities, such as Binance, Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency industry in general. On the other hand, less accessible and less diagnostic crypto entities/currencies like Ethereum and Coinbase did not experience negative spillover from the scandal.",537e6d32-f8f9-4e2e-8fbc-1b71f654d0b6,2,25,(missing PubMedId)

We demonstrate that firms with higher sentiment connectedness are more likely to crash as they spread more irrational sentiment signals and are more sensitive to investor behaviors. Notably, we find that the effect of investor sentiment on crash risk mainly stems from sentiment connectedness among firms rather than firms‚Äô individual sentiment, especially when market sentiment is surging or declining. These findings remain robust after controlling for other determinants of crash risk, including stock price synchronicity, accounting conservatism, and internal corporate governance strength. Our results underscore the importance of sentiment connectedness among firms and provide valuable insights for risk management among investors and regulatory authorities involved in monitoring risk.",3b45f28c-a493-4aa4-a8b0-912868c9cc07,3,119,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40282580

It analyzes daily data from 2015 to 2025, incorporating key economic and financial indicators such as the S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Treasury yield spreads, Federal Funds Rate, long-term Treasury rates, inflation, Brent oil prices, major exchange rates, and the Volatility Index. Separate predictive models for Bitcoin and Ethereum achieved high accuracy (R¬≤ = 0.999 and R¬≤ = 0.995, respectively), demonstrating the model's strong forecasting capability. The findings reveal that cryptocurrencies are increasingly influenced by traditional financial markets, particularly US stock indices, highlighting their integration into the global economic system. Bitcoin emerged as relatively stable and less sensitive to monetary policy shifts, functioning as a speculative hedge. In contrast, Ethereum showed greater sensitivity to liquidity and interest rate variables due to its linkage with decentralized finance applications. The study concludes that machine learning methods, combined with traditional macroeconomic indicators, can effectively explain and predict cryptocurrency market behavior, offering a foundation for developing new hybrid economic models tailored to the unique nature of digital assets.",c447c546-9e88-4e30-8f68-ecf888b2c4f2,0,0,(missing PubMedId)
10.3390/COMPUTATION13080201,Sentiment-Driven Statistical Modelling of Stock Returns over Weekends,"Pablo Kowalski Kutz,  Roman N. Makarov",Computation,2025,"We propose a two-stage statistical learning framework to investigate how financial news headlines posted over weekends affect stock returns. In the first stage, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to extract sentiment features from news headlines, including FinBERT sentiment scores and Impact Probabilities derived from Logistic Regression models (Binomial, Multinomial, and Bayesian). These Impact Probabilities estimate the likelihood that a given headline influences the stock‚Äôs opening price on the following trading day. In the second stage, we predict over-weekend log returns using various sets of covariates: sentiment-based features, traditional financial indicators (e.g., trading volumes, past returns), and headline counts. We evaluate multiple statistical learning algorithms‚Äîincluding Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines‚Äîusing cross-validation and two performance metrics. Our framework is demonstrated using financial news from MarketWatch and stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2014 to 2023. The results show that incorporating sentiment features, particularly Impact Probabilities, improves predictive accuracy. This approach offers a robust way to quantify and model the influence of qualitative financial information on stock performance, especially in contexts where markets are closed but news continues to develop.",aa2a4ef9-e2b4-4d22-9579-60d45480e46c,0,64,(missing PubMedId)

Using a survey-based sentiment index of ‚Äúsentix‚Äù, our results suggest strong evidence of nonlinearity and structural breaks making the use of linear causality models unreliable. Using a kernel-based multivariate nonlinear causality test, we find that causality runs from Eurozone to the US, Asia and Japan, with Japan also causing the Eurozone sentiment, and Latin America causing the Japanese sentiment. Interestingly, when we apply rolling estimations to detect time-varying causality for the cases of Eurozone and the US, Eurozone and Asia, Eurozone and Japan and Latin America and Japan, the results suggest evidence of bidirectional spillovers during certain months of the recent global financial crisis, and thereafter. Overall, our findings indicate that the sentiments of Japan, Asia and the US are related quite strongly with that of the Eurozone, as well as the sentiments of Japan and Latin America.",d7625603-803c-4906-9854-0874004c7b5a,23,59,(missing PubMedId)

10.1080/1351847X.2025.2477696,Cryptocurrency jump contagion with market sentiment events: a study of high frequency cross effect,"Steve Y. Yang,  Dan Pirjol,  Beichen Zhang,  Quan Li",European Journal of Finance,2025,"This study aims to understand the contagion effect of the major equity market sentiment events, defined as jumps in the VIX index, on cryptocurrency price jumps and the corresponding feedback effect on investors' sentiment. Using recent high frequency intraday data with multivariate Hawkes processes, we find that several noteworthy contagion effects exist between Bitcoin and the market sentiment proxied by the VIX index. First of all, we find that positive market sentiment jumps tend to trigger a moderate level of cross-contagion on both positive and negative jumps in the Bitcoin market, whereas negative market sentiment jumps have no contagion effect on the Bitcoin prices. We also find that the Bitcoin market shows stronger positive self-contagion and cross-contagion effects than the equity market, in general. We also observe a lasting fear of missing out (FOMO) phenomenon in Bitcoin. It is supported by the evidence that the effect of positive jumps in the Bitcoin market lasts three times as long as that in both the equity market and the negative Bitcoin price jumps, and these positive jumps in Bitcoin may serve as a harbinger of equity market movement. These findings provide a better understanding of risk control and policy guidance for the cryptocurrency market.",e47825f1-3606-478c-955c-796700545f4c,1,92,(missing PubMedId)

By employing a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model, we initially develop measures of spillover specific to individual cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, we employ unique data on cryptocurrency-specific sentiment to assess its impact on these spillover measures using panel fixed effects regression analysis. Our findings indicate that news media sentiment plays a significant role in explaining the spillover dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional assets, it appears that only positive sentiment affects the spillovers among cryptocurrencies, suggesting an asymmetric effect. Taking into account various characteristics of cryptocurrencies, we find that sentiment's impact on spillover is more pronounced in community-based coins than in those driven by firms. An examination of news content suggests that sentiment pertaining to emotional and risk aspects of cryptocurrencies predominantly influences these spillovers. Additionally, a comparative analysis of sentiment derived from social media and traditional news sources reveals a stronger influence of the former on spillover effects. Through extensive robustness checks, our research consistently affirms the pivotal role of sentiment in driving spillovers among cryptocurrency returns, underlining the importance of sentiment analysis in understanding the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.",3b9bb948-ab66-4dd1-a8ba-ac446f51bad8,17,134,(missing PubMedId)
