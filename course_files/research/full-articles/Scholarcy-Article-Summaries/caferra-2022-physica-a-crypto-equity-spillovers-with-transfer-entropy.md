## Abstract
==This study examines the sentiment–returns relationship in both stock (S&amp;P500) and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) markets==. An explorative wavelet analysis evidences period of episodic interconnectedness across different data frequencies. Therefore, Transfer Entropy (ET) measures remark the relative statistical significance, frequently outperforming traditional (VAR) estimates. In particular, ET methods successfully identify the mediating role of sentiments in connecting the two different markets. Hence, it is discussed how the potential cryptocurrencies indirect linkage with real economy moves through market sentiments.

## Quote
> This study examines the relationship between sentiment metrics and financial returns in stock and cryptocurrency markets, using a combination of techniques including Wavelet analysis and Rényi Transfer Entropy, and finds that sentiments play a mediating role in shaping and transmitting investors' beliefs across markets.

## Key points
- Cryptocurrencies are revolutionizing the financial landscape, attracting the attention of different investors and scholars
- Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) coefficients are inconclusive8 Here, we introduce the Rényi Transfer entropy (RTE)
- It is evident how the two markets influence each other through sentiments spread among investors
- Investments’ strategies seem to be influenced by sentiments, rather than price dynamics
- Future researches might identify and analyze the sign of the specific indirect transmission channel supposed in the paper and the impact during specific financial market periods, identifying whether crypto and economic sentiments become more relevant and more connected in specific periods of market distress
- This letter acts as a magnifier on the crypto and real world, proposing them as two distinct but interconnected spheres


## Summary

### Sentiment
The study examines the sentiment–returns relationship in both stock (S&amp;P500) and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) markets.
Sentiment flow from different economic and financial spheres impacts investors' mood and preferences in related markets.
The general impact of information and sentiment flow in financial markets is considered as a potential mediating variable through which the two spheres are connected.

### Methodology
The analysis consists of different steps, merging different methodologies, including wavelet analysis, traditional linear causality (VAR) models, and entropy-based variants, such as mutual information and Rényi Transfer entropy measures.
The wavelet coherence approach analyzes co-movements between time series, both in the time and frequency domain, while the comparison across frequencies helps identify synchronization at different scales.

### Results
The wavelet coherence analysis shows a general disconnection between sentiment metrics and financial returns series, with some market-specific sentiments–returns connections observed at lower frequencies.
The study finds that entropy-based methods, such as Transfer Entropy, successfully identify the mediating role of sentiments in connecting the two different markets, and that the potential indirect linkage between cryptocurrencies and the stock market passes through sentiment spillovers.

### Causality
The study examines the causality between market regimes, including the relationship between the ESI-S&amp;P500 and CSI-BTC, using traditional metrics and entropy-based variants.
The results show that mutual information methods outperform Pearson's correlation in identifying connectivity.
The VAR (1 lag) causality method is also used to test correlation and causality.

### Sentiment Analysis
The research analyzes the sentiment-returns relationship within and between stock and cryptocurrencies markets.
The results suggest that crypto sentiments and Bitcoin prices co-move, with the latter influencing investors' preferences.
Economic sentiments influence Bitcoin dynamics, while 'Crypto' sentiments affect stock market returns.

### Market Influence
The study finds that the two markets influence each other through sentiments spread among investors.
The results imply a 'mediating' role of sentiment in shaping and transmitting investors' beliefs across markets.
The findings are useful for investors and policy-makers, highlighting the linkage and influence of cryptocurrencies on traditional financial and economic instability.


## Study subjects

### 537 common observations
- Financial returns have been computed as the log differences of the adjusted daily price, while the first differences of Crypto sentiments (CS) and Economic Sentiments (ES) are employed.3. ==The period starts from the 01/01/2018 (after the peak of the Bitcoin bubble) and it ends with the advent of COVID-194 on the 20 of February 2020, obtaining 537 common observations per time series==. Descriptive statistics (Table 1) remarks the high volatility of both Bitcoin returns and related sentiments variations.5

## Data analysis
- #method/vector_autoregressive_model
- #method/vector_autoregressive_models

##  Builds on previous research
- Shannon [^25] has been introduced in the past to describe financial time series processes, especially to understand the pattern of connections in a globalized world [^2]. Essentially, such methodology is based on ==the analysis of uncertainty that different states of the world might generate, and then, on the different probabilities that different events might occur==.

## Differs from previous work
- As reviewed in Scaramozzino et al [^16], information theory dated back to the pioneer work of Shannon [^25] in 1948. From then on, ==we have waited different years to observe an application to the financial market contexts== [^26].

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- At a glance, it is possible to observe how mutual information methods (always statistically significant) outperform Pearson’s correlation in identify connectivity. ==Furthermore, both Correlation and Mutual Information are statistically significant in the Bitcoin relationship with both economic and crypto mood, evidencing the sensitivity and volatility of this instrument== [^20],[^34].
- This is observable from the decrease of TE as q increases. Considering H1, ==we observe that crypto sentiments and Bitcoin prices co-move, with the latter influencing investors preferences (similarly to== [^35]).

## Limitations
- The study notes that the direct relationship between cryptocurrencies and the stock market has been found to have scarce connection in previous studies, and that more efforts are required to identify potential linkages with the real economic scenario.
- The limitations of the study include the potential for indirect transmission channels between sentiment metrics and financial returns. The study also notes that the results may be influenced by specific financial market periods.

## Future work
- The study suggests that further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between sentiments and price dynamics in the stock and cryptocurrency markets, and to explore the potential applications of entropy-based methods.
- Future work may include identifying and analyzing the sign of the specific indirect transmission channel supposed in the paper. Additionally, future research may focus on identifying whether crypto and economic sentiments become more relevant and more connected in specific periods of market distress.
