## Summary

### Introduction
The study examines the connectedness of firm-level online investor sentiment using Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent stocks, leveraging two proxies of online textual sentiment: news media and social media sentiment.
The research investigates sentiment connectedness at two levels: frequency interval and asymmetric level.

### Sentiment Connectedness
The results reveal consistency in connectedness across short-, medium-, and long-term investing horizons for both news and social media sentiments.
Regarding asymmetric connectedness, negative news sentiment has a higher connectedness than positive news sentiments.
The study also finds that sentiment contagion in the time–frequency domain and asymmetric connectedness of online investor sentiment are significant.
The study examines the connectedness of firm-level online investor sentiment within the DJIA stock network using two proxies for online textual sentiment: news and social media.
The results show that sentiment connectedness is dominant in the short-term frequency interval, indicating that sentiment shocks are mostly transmitted in the short-term.
Negative news sentiment is more connected than positive news sentiment, which is in line with the literature reporting that investors react more to negative news than they do to positive news.

### Methodology
The study uses the time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) frequency connectedness approach to disaggregate connectedness among variables into different frequency intervals.
The sample period spans from January 1, 2016, to April 30, 2023, and includes 29 DJIA constituents.
Social media and news media sentiment scores are extracted from Bloomberg Inc.

### Data Characteristics
The study finds that most stocks have positive news and social media averages, indicating that listed stocks are associated with positive sentiment on these platforms.
The bootUR test shows that all series are stationary, and the Fat-tailed normality test reveals that the firm-level variables are not normally distributed at the 1% significance level.

### Connectedness Approach
The study uses the Chatziantoniou et al (2021) connectedness approach to establish the connectedness of online investor sentiment in a time–frequency space.
This method decomposes time-series data into key components, revealing the fine-grained details of short-, medium-, and long-term relationships between assets.
The approach incorporates time-varying coefficients and variance–covariance structures, offering valuable insights for investors.

### Sentiment Spillovers
The study analyzes the asymmetries in how online investor sentiment connects across different stocks and identifies three types of spillover effects: normal, positive, and negative.
The results show that IBM is the most influential stock in terms of news sentiment, while MSFT is the most influential in terms of Twitter sentiment in the short run.
The study also finds that negative sentiment is more connected than positive sentiment, and that the time-varying total connectedness is consistently less than the negative sentiment connectedness.

### Market Efficiency
The quick transmission of sentiment shocks across different stocks is consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which postulates that information is instantaneously incorporated into asset prices.
However, the fact that there is some level of connectedness that still exists in the medium- and long-term shows that markets are not “perfectly efficient” as the sentiment shocks transmitted across firms could still be used by long-term investors in their investing decisions.

### Policy Implications
The findings have several policy implications, including the need for regulatory authorities to monitor and analyze sentiment data from news and social media platforms to facilitate the early detection of potential market disruptions and excessive volatility.
Policymakers and investors should pay particular attention to negative sentiment connectedness, as it appears to be stronger than positive sentiment connectedness, potentially leading to more pronounced market reactions during periods of uncertainty or negative events.

##  Builds on previous research
- where \(z_{t} , z_{t - 1}\) and \(u_{t}\) are \(k \times 1\) dimensional vectors in \(t\), \(t - 1\) and the corresponding error term, respectively. \({\varvec{B}}_{t}\) and \({\Sigma }_{t}\) are the \(k \times k\) dimensional matrices demonstrating the time-varying VAR coefficients and the time-varying variance-covariances, \(vec(B_{t} )\) and \(v_{t}\) are the \(k^{2} \times 1\) dimensional vectors, and \({\text{R}}_{t}\) is a \(k^{2} \times k^{2}\) dimensional matrix. ==To establish the connectedness of online investor sentiment in a time–frequency space, we use the== [^Chatziantoniou_et+al_2021_a][^Chatziantoniou_et+al_2021_a]) connectedness approach.
- $$ z_{t}^{ - } = (1 - S_{t)} .z_{t} $$. To examine how investor sentiment connects across ==different stocks and identify potential asymmetries in these connections, we adopt the asymmetric connectedness approach proposed by== [^Adekoya_et+al_2022_a]).

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- The details of the TVP-VAR frequency connectedness approach can be found in [^Chatziantoniou_et+al_2021_a][^Chatziantoniou_et+al_2021_a]). ==In line with existing literature (e.g. [^Baruník_2018_a]), we decompose our frequency bands into 1 to 5 days, 5 to 20 days, and 20 days to infinity, representing the short-, medium-, and long-term==.
- In other words, the market overreacts to good news but underreacts to bad news. ==These results confirm earlier results reported by== [^Frank_2018_a]), who investigate how the stock market absorbs shocks using a comprehensive set of news stories about S&amp;P 500 firms from 1982 to 2013. [^Frank_2018_a]) find that the stock market overreacts to good news and underreacts to bad news. [^Zhou_et+al_2023_a]) report that optimistic investor sentiment is more connected than pessimistic investor sentiment is.
- Starting with frequency connectedness, the results show that sentiment connectedness is dominant in the short-term frequency interval, indicating that sentiment shocks are mostly transmitted in the short-term. ==These results are in line with those of== [^Su_2020_a]), who report that sentiment connectedness is more pronounced in the short run.
- We also observe that negative news sentiment is more connected than positive news sentiment. ==This is in line with the literature reporting that investors react more to negative news than they do to positive news, probably because of the negativity bias in news reporting== ([^Sprenger_et+al_2014_a]).
- This is in line with the literature reporting that investors react more to negative news than they do to positive news, probably because of the negativity bias in news reporting ([^Sprenger_et+al_2014_a]). ==The findings provide additional proof that news platforms have a strong bias toward reporting more negative than positive occurrences, in line with the adage, “bad news is good news”== ([^Soroka_2015_a]).

## Counterpoint to earlier claims
- Owing to the aforementioned “negativity bias” in response to mass media news, we also expect the contagion of the associated negative news sentiment to be more pronounced than that of positive news sentiment. ==While most studies have documented stronger investor reactions to negative news than they have to positive news, some have reported contradictory results==. [^Ma_et+al_2021_a]) examine how investors in the Chinese stock market respond to both good and bad news.
- The findings provide additional proof that news platforms have a strong bias toward reporting more negative than positive occurrences, in line with the adage, “bad news is good news” ([^Soroka_2015_a]). However, ==these results are contrary to those reported in a Chinese environment, where positive sentiment displays a more substantial contagion effect than negative sentiment, indicating that optimistic market sentiment has a greater impact on spreading and influencing other participants’ attitudes and behaviors within the financial ecosystem== ([^Zhou_et+al_2023_a]).

## Contributions
- <mark class="claim"><mark class="fact">This study examines the connectedness of firm-level online investor sentiment within the DJIA stock network</mark></mark>. <mark class="claim">We explore investor connectedness using two proxies for online textual sentiment at the aggregate, frequency interval, and asymmetric levels</mark>. <mark class="fact">Aggregate sentiment connectedness is consistent with the seminal work of Diebold</mark> and Yilmaz connectedness measures and measures total connectedness. Frequency connectedness seeks to disaggregate connectedness into three investment horizons, representing the short-, medium-, and long-term. In contrast, asymmetric connectedness disaggregates sentiment to understand how pessimistic and <mark class="fact">optimistic sentiment shocks are transmitted on news</mark> and social media platforms.

## Limitations
- The study does not explicitly state its limitations, but it acknowledges that most empirical studies on sentiment contagion concentrate on cross-asset contagion rather than on a single asset class.
- The study has a limitation in that it is biased towards large companies due to the lack of quality sentiment data for smaller stocks. The study suggests that future studies can use larger and more heterogeneous samples, including smaller stocks, to gain a better understanding of sentiment connectedness.

## Future work
- The study suggests that future research could investigate sentiment contagion in other asset classes or markets, and explore the relationship between sentiment contagion and market outcomes.
- The future work that can be done based on this study is to examine the connectedness of online investor sentiment across different markets and asset classes, and to investigate the impact of sentiment shocks on stock prices.
- The study suggests that future studies can link the findings of the investor connectedness measures obtained from the study with stock market outcomes such as returns and volatility. The study also suggests that future studies can utilize primary data rather than depending on third-party data providers.
