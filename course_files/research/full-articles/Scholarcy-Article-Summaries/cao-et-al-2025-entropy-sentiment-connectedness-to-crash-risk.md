## Abstract
Using a sample of S&amp;P 500 stocks, this paper examines the investor sentiment spillover network between firms and assesses how the sentiment connectedness in the network impacts stock price crash risk. ==We demonstrate that firms with higher sentiment connectedness are more likely to crash as they spread more irrational sentiment signals and are more sensitive to investor behaviors==. Notably, we find that the effect of investor sentiment on crash risk mainly stems from sentiment connectedness among firms rather than firms’ individual sentiment, especially when market sentiment is surging or declining. These findings remain robust after controlling for other determinants of crash risk, including stock price synchronicity, accounting conservatism, and internal corporate governance strength. Our results underscore the importance of sentiment connectedness among firms and provide valuable insights for risk management among investors and regulatory authorities involved in monitoring risk.

## Summary

### Sentiment Connectedness
The paper examines the impact of sentiment connectedness on stock price crash risk, demonstrating that firms with higher sentiment connectedness are more likely to crash as they spread more irrational sentiment signals and are more sensitive to investor behaviors.
The sentiment connectedness is driven by the exogenous investor sentiment factor, often regarded as irrational and weakly related to company fundamentals.
The paper uses the nonlinear Granger causality method to study the sentiment spillover network among S&amp;P 500 stocks and measures the sentiment connectedness of a firm based on different network centrality measurements.
The study measures the sentiment connectedness of firms based on the sentiment spillover network.
Four primary types of sentiment network centralities are considered: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
The study also quantifies a firm's sentiment connectedness by aggregating these centrality indexes using the entropy method.
The sentiment connectedness of a firm is driven by exogenous investor behavioral factors rather than company fundamentals.
The connectedness of investor sentiment cannot be solely attributed to company financial characteristics, and a firm can establish connections through its influence on another firm's sentiment.
The temporal evolution of network density characterizes systemic interconnectedness, with crisis periods exhibiting pronounced spikes in sentiment network density.
The study examines the relationship between sentiment connectedness and stock price crash risk, finding that companies with higher sentiment connectedness have a higher ability to receive and disseminate sentiment, exacerbating investor blindness and irrationality.
Sentiment connectedness is significantly related to crash risk in whole samples, and its influence on crash risk is different in three sub-samples.
The effect of sentiment changes on stock prices becomes weaker during severe market stress, but sentiment connectedness is a better predictor of crash risk, especially during market extremes.

### Crash Risk
The paper finds that a firm's sentiment connectedness is significantly and positively related to crash risk, showing that a firm with higher connectedness in the sentiment network is more vulnerable to crashes.
The relationship between sentiment connectedness and crash risk can be explained in two dimensions: a highly interconnected firm may be more influential in spreading sentiment shocks, and a highly connected member may be more easily influenced by others.
The paper also examines the relationship between sentiment connectedness and crash risk under different market conditions, finding that sentiment connectedness has stronger explanatory power for crash risk than a firm's individual sentiment.
The impact of sentiment connectedness on stock price crash risk is examined using panel regression models.
The results show a positive association between sentiment connectedness and stock price crash risk, suggesting that sentiment connectedness contributes to the amplification of crash risk.
The results are robust to various tests, including endogeneity analysis, propensity score-matched method, and controlling for peer effects and high-frequency trading.

### Methodology
The paper uses a novel firm sentiment connectedness index, referred to as FirmSentix, to measure the connection and spillover of each firm.
The index is based on the entropy weight method and aggregates different network centrality indexes.
The paper also employs two-stage least squares estimation and propensity score matching to address potential endogeneity issues.
The sentiment spillover network is constructed using the nonlinear Granger network method, and the turnover rate is used as the measure of investor sentiment.
The study uses a VAR model to examine the nonlinear Granger causality test for stationary time series.
The VAR residuals are used to perform a BDS test, which is based on the correlation dimension of the nonlinear structure in the test time series.
The null hypothesis is that Xt is not Granger causing Yt.
The study also uses a fixed-effect model to identify the impact of sentiment connectedness on crash risk.
The study uses various metrics, including sentiment connectedness, crash risk, financial condition, conservatism score, and stock return synchronicity, to analyze the relationship between market sentiment and stock prices.
The authors employ regression analysis and other statistical methods to measure these metrics and test their hypotheses.
The data used in the study includes firm-specific weekly returns, financial statements, and market data.

### Crash Risk Measurement
The study uses two crash risk measures: negative conditional return skewness (NCSKEW) and down-to-up volatility (DUVOL).
The NCSKEW is calculated by taking the negative of the third moment of firm-specific weekly returns for each year and dividing it by the cubic standard deviation of firm-specific weekly returns.
The DUVOL is calculated by separating the weeks with firm-specific weekly returns above the annual average from those with firm-specific returns below the annual mean and computing the standard deviation for each subset of weeks.

### Network Construction
The sentiment spillover network is constructed between S&amp;P 500 stocks from 2006 to 2021, with nodes representing firms and directed arrows showing the spillover between firms.
The network exhibits a highly heterogeneous distribution pattern, with most nodes having limited sentiment linkages and a small subset demonstrating significant connectivity.
Crisis periods, such as 2008 and 2020, display more pronounced heterogeneity and connectedness compared to non-crisis years.

### Moderating Effects
The study investigates the moderating effects of stock price synchronicity and accounting conservatism on the relationship between sentiment connectedness and crash risk.
The results show that stock return synchronicity amplifies the influence of sentiment connectedness on stock price crash risk, while accounting conservatism mitigates the effect.
The study also examines the moderating effects of ownership structure and financial condition, finding that a low-concentrated shareholding structure strengthens the influence of spillover networks on firm crash risk, and that the association between sentiment connectedness and crash risk is more prominent in financial-distress firms.

### Implications
The study's findings have implications for risk management frameworks, suggesting that sentiment spillover networks play a critical role in propagating crash risk.
The research highlights the need to incorporate sentiment connections into risk management frameworks and to prioritize monitoring sentiment connectedness alongside traditional risk measures.
The study also contributes to the understanding of how shared investor psychology and information diffusion through financial networks impact market outcomes, and presents an innovative behavioral finance perspective by combining social networks with investor sentiment.

### Regulation
Analysis of information flow and investor sentiment on social networks can help regulatory bodies detect illegal activities like market manipulation and misinformation, ensuring market order.
This research can also aid in crafting sound policies to promote the healthy use of social networks in finance and protect investor interests.

### Investment
Firms with high sentiment connectedness are more prone to stock price crashes.
Retail investors can use sentiment connectedness metrics to spot centrally positioned companies in sentiment networks, which may experience sharp price swings during market mood shifts.
Investors should be mindful of inter-firm sentiment spillovers and consider selecting unconnected stocks for sector-based asset allocation to reduce sentiment-linked risks.


## Study subjects

### 500 firms
- The average crash risk measure (NCSKEWi,t ) stands at 0.5845, aligning with prior empirical findings. ==These results highlight the elevated crash risk among S&amp;P 500 firms, underscoring their relevance for in-depth investigation==. Note: This table reports the mean, median, standard deviation, and upper and lower quartiles of the data used for panel regression and network construction

## Findings
- Robust t-statistics in parentheses. *** p &lt; 0.01, ** p &lt; 0.05, * p &lt; 0.1
- We test the sentiment and its connectedness in the whole sample, the upsurge sub-sample and the downsurge sub-sample. <mark class="claim">We find that both the firm’s individual sentiment and the sentiment spillover network are significantly related to crash risk in whole samples</mark>
- We define a high ownership concentration if a firm’s initial shareholder ratio is greater than 25%, and other firms have a low shareholding concentration

##  Builds on previous research
- As a widely accessible metric computed directly from stock exchange data, the turnover ratio explicitly measures sentiment in equity markets rather than other financial markets [^62]. Table 1 ==reports the descriptive statistics for key variables in this study==.

## Differs from previous work
- ==However, accounting conservatism restricts executives’ opportunities to conceal bad news, increases information transparency, and reduces investor sensitivity [^42],[^43],[^44]. Furthermore, through heterogeneity analysis, we show that extreme risk events and poor company governance can improve the effect of sentiment connectedness on crash risk==.
- First, the sentiment connectedness among firms is studied, and a corresponding sentiment spillover network is constructed. ==While many prior studies focus on the economic impacts of investor sentiments== (see, e.g., Kumar and Lee (2006) [^45], De et al (1990) [^46], and Han (2008) [^47]), they overlook the interplay of individual sentiments.
- Second, this paper expands the investigation of firm crash risk by considering the effect of sentiment connectedness among firms. ==Prior research has predominantly concentrated on analyzing fundamental factors such as managerial characteristics and company fundamentals== (see, [^48],[^49],[^50], etc.).
- It is important to note that our sentiment networks are driven by exogenous investor behavioral factors rather than company fundamentals. ==This distinguishes our study from previous research on financial networks that focused on business connections== [^24],[^31] or price linkage [^22],[^28].
- We compare the impact of sentiment and its connectedness on crash risk in this part. ==Different from firms’ individual sentiment, connectedness focuses on the interdependence and co-movement among individual sentiments, which are more likely to happen during extreme conditions== [^40],[^41].

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- All the data used in this study are from the WIND database. ==Similar to Baker et al (2012) [^20], we choose the turnover rate of a firm as our primary sentiment proxy==.
- Since the importance of a company in the sentiment spillover network gives it a high ability to acquire and propagate information in a certain group or ==different groups, this raises the herd effect and irrational behavior of investors, causing crash risk [^29]. This result confirms the robustness of our main regression in Table 2==. .

## Limitations
- The study does not explicitly discuss its limitations, but it notes that the results are based on a sample of S&amp;P 500 stocks and may not be generalizable to other markets or contexts.

## Future work
- The study suggests that future research could explore the role of sentiment connectedness in other contexts, such as in different markets or industries. The study also notes that further research could examine the impact of sentiment connectedness on other outcomes, such as trading volume and market liquidity.
