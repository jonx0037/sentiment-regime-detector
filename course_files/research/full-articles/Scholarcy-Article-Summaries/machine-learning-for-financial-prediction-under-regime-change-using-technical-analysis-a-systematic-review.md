## Abstract
Recent crises, recessions and bubbles have stressed the non-stationary nature and the presence of drastic structural changes in the financial domain. The most recent literature suggests the use of conventional machine learning and statistical approaches in this context. Unfortunately, several of these techniques are unable or slow to adapt to changes in the price-generation process. ====This study aims to survey the relevant literature on Machine Learning for financial prediction under regime change employing a systematic approach==.It reviews key papers with a special emphasis on technical analysis==. The study discusses the growing number of contributions that are bridging the gap between two separate communities, one focused on data stream learning and the other on economic research. However, it also makes apparent that we are still in an early stage. The range of machine learning algorithms that have been tested in this domain is very wide, but the results of the study do not suggest that currently there is a specific technique that is clearly dominant.

## Summary

### Introduction
Financial markets are complex systems with non-stationary nature and drastic structural changes.
Recent crises and recessions have highlighted the need for adaptive machine learning techniques to predict financial trends under regime change.
The study aims to survey the literature on machine learning for financial prediction under regime change, with a focus on technical analysis.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms have been successful in mapping nonlinear relationships in financial data.
Deep learning algorithms and ensembles have obtained the best results for stock trend prediction.
However, the literature on machine learning for financial prediction under regime change is limited and sparse.
Online incremental ML algorithms seem especially appropriate for handling non-stationarities, shifts, and drifts in price generation processes.
Machine learning (ML) techniques, including regime-switching models, have been applied to financial prediction under regime changes.
These techniques can detect changes in market regimes and predict future values.
Deep learning (DL) approaches, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have also been used to address concept changes in financial data.
Online incremental algorithms, including clustering and forecasting algorithms, have been used to adapt to different cycles or seasonal behaviors in data streams.

### Regime Change
Regime change refers to a change in the collective behavior of market participants and their reactions.
The estimation of the hidden processes driving the market into different regimes is often approached using regime-switching models.
Detecting concept shifts helps lower the risks of financial exposure in high-frequency trading.
The study aims to identify directions on leveraging the benefits of modern algorithms that work with different scenarios and deal with any changes that may arise in real-time.

### Literature Review
The study reviewed 223 research works, classifying them into relevant, process assessment, and excluded works.
The relevant works were further filtered based on their relation to regime changes or structural breaks in non-stationary data and machine learning forecasting in the financial field.
A total of 140 publications were classified as relevant, with the majority corresponding to machine learning techniques applied to stock forecasting.

### Research Classification
The relevant studies were classified into two major areas: financial regime changes and data stream learning.
The financial regime changes area focuses on statistical approaches to detect change points or forecast under different regimes, while the data stream learning area deals with the problem of concept drift.
The study found that the literature on online learning does not tend to coincide with the one on regime changes, but both areas tackle similar challenges, such as having up-to-date models and re-training mechanisms.

### Machine Learning Techniques
The study extracted data from the relevant publications, including the machine learning techniques used.
The techniques were grouped into eight broad categories, with the majority of the reviewed papers using techniques from four main categories: evolving systems, ensemble-based systems, traditional systems adapted to concept change, and neural networks and deep learning.
The study found that machine learning algorithms can handle nonlinear relationships without prior knowledge, outperforming traditional time series methods, and can be used to predict price changes depending on the time horizon and efficiency of the market.

### Market Changes
Financial markets are non-stationary and subject to regime changes or structural breaks, which can be abrupt and may or may not be transitory.
These changes can significantly impact financial exposure, and timely recognition of them is crucial.
The adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) suggests that market efficiency evolves as market participants adapt to a changing environment.

### Concept Drift
Concept drift, which refers to changes in the underlying distribution of data, is a significant challenge in financial prediction.
Various techniques, including meta-learning, evolving intelligent systems (EIS), and ensemble methods, have been proposed to address concept drift.
These techniques can adapt to changing market conditions and improve the accuracy of financial predictions.
Meta-learning approaches, in particular, have shown promise in predicting the sequence of change between discrete concepts and maximizing profits in trading strategies.

### ML In Finance
Machine learning (ML) has proven to be a powerful tool for tackling financial prediction under concept drift, which refers to structural breaks that can occur at any frequency level.
Many meta-learning approaches rely on non-supervised algorithms to identify the recurrence of a concept and retrieve previous models or detect drifts.
The use of sequential deep learning models, such as RNNs, can be insufficient to tackle abrupt changes due to the memory of previous market dynamics.

### Techniques And Models
Researchers suggest solutions based on model retraining at regular intervals or upon detection of changes or drifts, or online incremental algorithms.
These approaches involve having up-to-date models with forgetting mechanisms to avoid overfitting and adapting to new market behaviors.
Ensembles and evolving fuzzy systems are popular solutions, and deep learning has fostered the popularity of approaches where artificial neural networks play a key role.

### Future Research
Future research is likely to emphasize the application of data stream classification algorithms to financial streams, and online machine learning has not been widely applied to the financial domain.
The availability of high-frequency data and computational resources will likely result in major progress in the near future, with a focus on handling price change dynamics and financial regime changes.


## Study subjects

### 140 relevant studies
- Total Publications 56 34 20 16 5 5 4. ==Fig. 2 shows how, out of a total of 140 relevant studies, the majority of the works reviewed to correspond to ML techniques applied to stock forecasting==. Some of these works overlap regime change research, focusing primarily on probabilistic models to classify directional changes and represent different regimes

### 20 data
- Records identi ied from: Databases (n = 7) Registers (n = 0). ==Records removed before screening: Duplicate record removed (n = 20) Records removed for not being available or not having a subscription (n = 8)==. Records screened (n = 643)

## Data analysis
- #method/evolving_clustering
- #method/baum_welch_algorithm
- #method/k_means
- #method/gaussian_distribution
- #method/welch
- #method/markov_model

## Findings
- <mark class="claim">These results show that most of the reviewed papers use techniques from four main categories: Evolving systems (that include Evolving clustering, Evolving fuzzy rules and Fuzzy neuro systems), Ensemble based systems (usually with treebased components), <mark class="fact">traditional systems adapted to concept change</mark></mark>

##  Builds on previous research
- Among the advantages that they offer, we can mention the fact they can handle non-stationarities, shifts, and drifts in price generation processes. ==Another aspect that makes them a good fit for this context is the fact that they are scalable for continuous learning scenarios== [^30].
- While its application to high-frequency markets is still an open problem, recent research works are making progress in understanding how to apply ML to intraday resolutions. ==Among them, we could mention the one presented by Sirignano and Cont== [^73], who claimed that financial data at high frequencies exhibit stylised facts and may hold learnable stationary patterns over long periods.

## Differs from previous work
- In finance, a change in the collective behaviour of market participants and their reactions is called a regime change (RC). As covered by the marked efficiency hypothesis [^25], ==we cannot observe the individual behaviour of a trader or its intentions==.
- We must also point out that the prediction of future financial trends can be tackled using fundamental or technical analysis. ==Despite some controversy regarding its potential== [^25], [^42], the latter is very prevalent in short-term trading [^43], hence the focus on this approach.

## Limitations
- The study limitations include the lack of comprehensive reviews on the topic. The study also notes that the literature on machine learning for financial prediction under regime change is limited and sparse.
- The limitations of the study are that it cannot guarantee completeness, and that some relevant works may have been missed. The study also notes that the classification of research works into relevant, process assessment, and excluded works may be subjective.
- The limitations of the study include the complexity of managing large amounts of data at high frequencies. The limitations also include the need for more research on seasonality and changes at the intraday level.

## Future work
- The study suggests that future work should focus on exploring the application of data stream learning and concept drift to financial markets. The study also notes that the development of new machine learning algorithms that can handle non-stationarities, shifts, and drifts in price generation processes is an area of future research.
- The future work suggested by the study includes further research on the use of machine learning techniques in financial forecasting, and the development of new methods for handling regime changes. The study also suggests that further research is needed on the application of regime-switching models to financial forecasting.
- The future work includes developing techniques to adapt to concept drifts and changes in market behaviour. The future work also includes applying machine learning techniques to high-frequency markets.
- The future work in this area is likely to focus on the application of data stream classification algorithms to financial streams, as well as the development of new machine learning techniques that can adapt to changing market conditions.
