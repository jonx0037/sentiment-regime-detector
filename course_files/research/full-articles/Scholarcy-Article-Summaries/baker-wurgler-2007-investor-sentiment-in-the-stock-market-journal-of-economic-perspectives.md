# [Investor Sentiment in the Stock Market]()

## [[Malcolm Baker]]; [[Jeffrey Wurgler]]

## Abstract
The history of the stock market is full of events striking enough to earn their own names: the Great Crash of 1929, the ’Tronics Boom of the early 1960s, the Go-Go Years of the late 1960s, the Nifty Fifty bubble of the early 1970s, the Black Monday crash of October 1987, and the Internet or Dot.com bubble of the 1990s. Each of these events refers to a dramatic level or change in stock prices that seems to defy explanation. The standard finance model, in which unemotional investors always force capital market prices to equal the rational present value of expected future cash flows, has considerable difficulty fitting these patterns. Researchers in behavioral finance have therefore been working to augment the standard model with an alternative model built on two basic assumptions.

## Quote
> The study examines the impact of investor sentiment on stock returns, finding that sentiment has a significant effect on stocks that are difficult to arbitrage or value, and that waves of sentiment have discernible effects on individual firms and the stock market as a whole.

## Key points
- The history of the stock market is full of events striking enough to earn their own names: the Great Crash of 1929, the ’Tronics Boom of the early 1960s, the Go-Go Years of the late 1960s, the Nifty Fifty bubble of the early 1970s, the Black Monday crash of October 1987, and the Internet or Dot.com bubble of the 1990s
- The new directions in this top-down approach build on the two broader and more irrefutable assumptions of behavioral finance— sentiment and limits to arbitrage—to explain which stocks are likely to be most affected by sentiment, rather than pointing out that the level of stock prices in the aggregate depends on sentiment
- We construct an index based on the six proxies we use in [^Baker_2006_a]): trading volume as measured by NYSE turnover; the dividend premium; the closed-end fund discount; the number and first-day returns on initial public offerings (IPOs); and the equity share in new issues
- In Baker and Wurgler (2006), we find that the best combination to capture the common variation in annual series includes the current values of the closed-end fund discount, the equity share, and IPO volume, and one-year-lagged versions of the three other variables
- Note: This figure shows the first principal component of levels and changes in six measures of sentiment: the closed-end fund discount (CEFD), detrended log turnover (TURN), number of IPOs (NIPO), first-day return on IPOs (RIPO), dividend premium (PDND), and equity share in new issues (S), each standardized and with the effect of macroeconomic conditions removed
- We show that it is quite possible to measure investor sentiment, and that waves of sentiment have clearly discernible, important, and regular effects on individual firms and on the stock market as a whole


## Summary

### Introduction To Behavioral Finance
The standard finance model has difficulty explaining dramatic levels or changes in stock prices, such as the Great Crash of 1929 and the Internet bubble of the 1990s.
Researchers in behavioral finance have been working to augment the standard model with an alternative model built on two basic assumptions: sentiment and limits to arbitrage.

### Investor Sentiment
The investor sentiment approach can be either "bottom up," using biases in individual investor psychology, or "top down" and macroeconomic, focusing on the measurement of reduced-form, aggregate sentiment.
The top-down approach builds on the two broader assumptions of behavioral finance to explain which stocks are likely to be most affected by sentiment.
Stocks of low capitalization, younger, unprofitable, high-volatility, non–dividend paying, growth companies or stocks of firms in financial distress are likely to be disproportionately sensitive to broad waves of investor sentiment.

### Effects Of Sentiment On Stocks
Theoretical effects of investor sentiment on stocks suggest that sentiment has a greater effect on stocks that are difficult to value and arbitrage, such as young, small, unprofitable, or extreme growth companies.
The sentiment seesaw model illustrates how stock valuations are affected by swings in sentiment, with high sentiment associated with high stock valuations, particularly for speculative and hard-to-arbitrage stocks.
Empirical evidence is needed to test whether more speculative and harder-to-arbitrage stocks are indeed more sensitive to sentiment, and whether bond-like stocks have negative sentiment betas.

### Sentiment
Investor sentiment is not straightforward to measure, but there are various proxies that can be used, including surveys, mood proxies, retail investor trades, mutual fund flows, trading volume, premia on dividend-paying stocks, closed-end fund discounts, option implied volatility, IPO first-day returns, IPO volume, new equity issues, and insider trading.
These proxies can be combined to create a sentiment index that fluctuates with major speculative episodes.
The effect of general demand for stock funds on monthly returns is higher for higher volatility portfolios, presumably because stocks therein are harder to arbitrage.
The effect of speculative demand is also increasing, reflecting the more speculative nature of volatile stocks.
Sentiment betas increase as stocks become more speculative and harder to arbitrage.
A one-standard-deviation increase in the sentiment changes index increases returns on the eighth volatility decile portfolio by about one percentage point, and over two percentage points for the tenth decile portfolio.

### Models
The classical risk-based and behavioral disagreement models make distinct predictions about the slope of the overall valuation line, but neither makes predictions about valuations conditional on sentiment.
The risk-based asset pricing models, such as the capital-asset pricing model, predict that stocks with higher market betas always have higher expected returns, while the behavioral model of disagreement among regular investors combined with short-sales constraints by arbitrageurs predicts that hard-to-short stocks can become overvalued.

### Predictability
The sentiment model predicts that hard-to-arbitrage stocks can be undervalued or overvalued conditional on the state of sentiment, and that return predictability helps to address the concern that sentiment measures may be contaminated by economic fundamentals.
The findings suggest that when sentiment is measured to be high, speculative and hard-to-arbitrage stocks have lower future returns on average than bond-like stocks, which is a powerful confirmation of the sentiment-driven mispricing view.
When sentiment is low, the average future returns of speculative stocks exceed those of bond-like stocks.
This pattern is inconsistent with classical asset pricing.
The unconditional average returns are slightly lower for speculative stocks, consistent with behavioral models of disagreement among investors combined with short-sales constraints.

### Measuring Sentiment
The authors construct an index of investor sentiment using six proxies: trading volume, dividend premium, closed-end fund discount, number and first-day returns on IPOs, and equity share in new issues.
These proxies are highly correlated and contain idiosyncratic components unrelated to sentiment.
To remove macroeconomic influences, each proxy is regressed on a set of macroeconomic indicators, and the residuals are used as sentiment proxies.
The six proxies are then averaged together into an index to iron out idiosyncrasies.

### Sentiment Index
The sentiment index is formed by taking the first principal component of the six proxies.
The index is standardized to have zero mean and unit variance over the 40-year period.
The coefficients of the proxies in the index have the expected signs, with share turnover, IPO volume, and IPO first-day returns positively associated with sentiment levels, and closed-end fund discount and dividend premium negatively associated.
The index captures major fluctuations in sentiment, including the 1967-1968 bubble, the early 1970s bear market, and the late-1990s technology bubble.

### Testing Sentiment Effects
The authors use the sentiment index to test for return predictability conditional on the state of sentiment and return comovement patterns associated with changes in sentiment.
They also examine the relationship between sentiment and mutual fund flows, finding a significant correlation between the sentiment changes index and speculative demand.
The authors then use the sentiment index to study the differential effects of investor sentiment across firms, sorting stocks according to their speculative appeal and difficulty of arbitrage.

### Aggregate Effects
The correlation between an equal-weighted market return index and the sentiment changes index is 0.43.
When sentiment is high, subsequent market returns are low, with average monthly returns of –0.41 percentage points for equal-weighted market index returns and –0.34 percentage points for value-weighted returns.
When sentiment is very low, monthly returns average 2.75 and 1.18 percentage points for equal- and value-weighted indexes, respectively.

## Data analysis
- #method/principal_components_analysis

##  Builds on previous research
- The categories vary from speculative “aggressive growth” funds to safer, dividend-paying “income” funds. Figure 3 shows ==the results of a principal components analysis of changes in fund flows, as in== [^Goetzmann_et+al_2000_a]).

## Differs from previous work
- Uncertainty means that the effect of overconfidence ([^Daniel_et+al_1998_a]), representativeness, and conservatism ([^Barberis_et+al_1998_a]) is more pronounced. ==Further, differences of opinion== ([^Miller_1977_a]), even when investors have the same basic information, can be large.

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- The dividend premium explains well the major historical trends in firms’ propensity to pay dividends, such as the post-1977 decline in this propensity documented by [^Fama_2001_a]); that is, when dividends are at a premium, firms are more likely to pay them, and are less so when they are discounted. In Baker and Wurgler (2004a, b), ==we define the dividend premium as the difference between the average market-tobook-value ratios of dividend payers and nonpayers==. .
- This pattern is a telling one—the fact that riskier stocks (at least, stocks that are riskier by all outward appearances) sometimes have lower expected returns is inconsistent with classical asset pricing in which investors bear risk because they are compensated by higher expected return. ==The unconditional average returns are slightly lower for speculative stocks, consistent with behavioral models of disagreement among investors combined with short-sales constraints== (such as [^Hong_2003_a]) and other models they discuss in the current issue of this journal).

## Contributions
- This paper outlines a “top down” approach to behavioral finance and the stock market. <mark class="fact">We take the origin of investor sentiment</mark> as exogenous and instead focus on its empirical effects. <mark class="claim">We show that it is quite possible to measure investor sentiment, and that waves of sentiment have clearly discernible, important, and regular effects on individual firms and on the stock market as a whole</mark>. In particular, stocks that are difficult to arbitrage or to <mark class="fact">value are most affected by sentiment</mark>. The sentiment seesaw diagram in Figure 1 summarizes our approach.

## Limitations
- The limitations of the study include the difficulty of distinguishing between the effects of sentiment and other factors on stock prices, and the challenge of measuring sentiment accurately. The study also notes that the effect of sentiment on aggregate returns will be muted if the prices of safe, easy-to-arbitrage stocks are inversely related to sentiment.
- The study notes that each part of the chain of events leading to sentiment is subject to confounding influences. The study also notes that surveys may not accurately reflect investor behavior.
- The study notes that data availability is a key constraint, and that some judgment has entered the approach to measuring sentiment. The study also notes that the process of averaging the six proxies is not crucial, and that some of the sentiment proxies reflect economic fundamentals to some extent.
- The study notes that there are other possible interpretations of the results, such as the possibility that speculative flows are highly correlated with the returns of speculative stocks simply because mutual fund investors chase returns, and that the sentiment changes index may be contaminated by economic fundamentals.

## Future work
- The study suggests that future work should focus on developing more accurate measures of sentiment and testing the predictions of the top-down approach using empirical evidence. The study also notes that the top-down approach can be used to study other markets and asset classes, such as bonds and commodities.
- The study suggests that future research could investigate the relationship between sentiment and stock returns in different markets and contexts. The study also suggests that future research could explore the use of new and innovative proxies for sentiment.
- The study suggests that future research should focus on characterizing and measuring uninformed demand or investor sentiment, understanding the foundations and variation in investor sentiment over time, and determining which particular stocks attract speculators or have limited arbitrage potential.
